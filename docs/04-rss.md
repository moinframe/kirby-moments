title: RSS Feed
---

The plugin can auto-generate an RSS feed of your images to be subscribed to by other people. The feed is disabled by default — to enable it, see the [configuration](/docs/moinframe-moments/02-configuration).

Once enabled, the feed will be available under your defined `storeid`, by default that's `moments`. If you have defined a custom `pageid`, the feed will be available under that slug.

You can access the feed in a browser like this:
`https://your-website.test/moments/feed.xml`
